# Writing a Smart Contract is a piece of `cake!`

`cake` is a sugared syntax way to write [Rusk](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk-vm) Smart Contract using the Rust language.

## Why "cake"?

In some cultures, rusk is made of cake, rather than bread: this is sometimes referred to as _"cake rusk"_.

## Example

Currently a prototype and highly experimental, for concrete examples see the
genesis contracts inside [rusk](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk).
